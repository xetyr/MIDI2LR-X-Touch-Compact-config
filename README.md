MIDI2LR > X-Touch Compact config files

Hey there,

You will find my config files for [MIDI2LR plugin]([url](https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/)https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/) with an Behringer X-Touch Compact controller.

Files description :<br>
• X-TOUCH > Layers A and B for X-Touch config through Behringer's software ;<br>
• XML > 4 XML files, according to my setup ;<br>
• TOOLS > 1 printable layout to stick on the controller, with labels. I printed it on a self-sticking paper, a must-have !<br>
• TOOLS > 1 Excel document recapitulating each config file ;<br>

Excel document is hugely inspired by @MarcksHouse, adapted to my needs. I'm not sharing his installation tutorial, because I guess MIDI2LR users know how to try it.
